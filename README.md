# Mobile-DeepISP
CSC 259/459 Computer Graphics &amp; Vision - Course Project <br />
Project Lead: Dr. Yuhao Zhu

Features:
- Designed a mobile-optimized end-to-end Image Signal Processing (ISP) Pipeline based on DeepISP <br />
- Enhanced multi-threading to achieve real-time image signal processing in low latency <br />
- Applied quantization and pruning to reduce 50% model size and 20 ms inference time per image <br />
- Trained the model on the Zurich RAW to RGB dataset, achieving a PSNR of 38 dB and SSIM of 0.95, <br />closely approximating desktop-level ISP quality on mobile hardware <br />
