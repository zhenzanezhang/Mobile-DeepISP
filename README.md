# Mobile-DeepISP
CSC 259/459 Computer Graphics &amp; Vision - Course Project
Project Lead: Dr. Yuhao Zhu

Features:
• Designed a mobile-optimized end-to-end Image Signal Processing (ISP) Pipeline based on DeepISP
• Enhanced multi-threading to achieve real-time image signal processing in low latency
• Applied quantization and pruning to reduce 50% model size and 20 ms inference time per image.
• Trained the model on the Zurich RAW to RGB dataset, achieving a PSNR of 38 dB and SSIM of 0.95, closely approximating desktop-level ISP quality on mobile hardware
